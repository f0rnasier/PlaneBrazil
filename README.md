# PlaneBrazil Flights #

Hello Guys,

This is PlaneBrazil Flights a REST API to work like a UBER for FLights. The main objective here is to establish all basic operations for this prototype project.

# HOW A UBER FOR FLIGHTS CAN WORK? #
This basically will work selling vacancy seats on empty flights returning to the base. Who knows wells how business jets and part 135 works are aware of there is sometimes where the airplane return to the base empty or it needs to fly to other locations to start a flight empty as well. The objective of PlaneBrazil Flights is to make the pilot or the chief of operation in control to post this empty flight to be bought for regular passengers. May they will not make a profit but for sure the money received on those flights will help a lot in the annual operation costs for those airplanes.

# HOW CAN I TEST IT ON MY COMPUTER? #
As this is a public repository you can clone it as you want to test. To access the database you will need credentials, you can get them directly with me on fornasier@gmail.com or you can create your database as well. I am using MongoDB on this project.

This is a REST API created to CRUD operations for the PlaneBrazil Website.
